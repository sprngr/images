> Project image assets for display on Github

This repository is to be a host for display images that will be used within other projects on Github. It will enable me to not have to bundle images for the README with the code, keeping things slightly cleaner and things that are just code can remain as such.

If this repo ever contains code, I've done something wrong. Probably.
